Upon arrival we chowed down their free basket of chips and salsa in no time (we loved them and I\'m picky about salsa), we ordered choriqueso dip to go with a 2nd basket of chips which the 2 of us ate down (plenty to serve for 4). For my entree I got this delicious thing I never heard of called El Torro which I highly recommend! My entree cost $6.25 and it was amazing (I\'m glad I ordered only 1, I feel that 3 would serve a family). My boyfriend got Alambre (a favorite of ours I recommend everyone try it) which was huge and delicious. (we sometimes get it as an appetizer to share with a group). We will definitely come back and will bring friends next time!',
